   <h3><u>The Elements of Data Science</u></h3>
   Pratika was born curious. All she ever did was ask questions. Why is the sky blue?, Why do people go to work?, Why do animals not speak?. Her insatiable
   curiosity of the world, brought about a lot of pressure on her parents. They therefore met with a wise sage and asked for his advice. After a few moments of silent
   contemplation the wise sage smiled and replied:<br>
   <q>You cannot stop the wind from blowing, nor can you stop the spring from flowing. When Pratika asks the question........you <em>must</em> seek the answer.</q><br><br>
   This short story summarizes the essence of data science. It means being curious enough to ask the right questions, having the courage to seek data and to search
   for data patterns, that will help answer the questions that we have. Like Pratika in the story, we all have an inherent curiosity. But how many of us are prepared
   to strive for the answers? Most of us are willing to let go. Put it off our minds. Why tax our awesomely unbright brains, when we could be doing more important
   things like "shopping online or going to the movies". And those who strive too seek answers are the ones known to the world as - <em>data scientists.</em><br>
